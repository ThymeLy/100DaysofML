# 100DaysofML

Inspired by #100DaysofCode and #100DaysofMLCode, starting mine as well, on 9 July 2020.
Also with some resources I find useful.

**Day 1 (9 July 2020)** - continuing on Google's Machine Learning Crash Course on ML Engineering [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning), also video on [Rules of Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml), continuing on Coursera Biology Meet Programming - it's evident that my Python fundamental is not strong enough

**Day 2 (10 July 2020)** - Google's Machine Learning Crash Course Data Dependencies, fairness; started on Khan Academy Linear Algebra

**Day 3 (11 July 2020)** - Completing Fairness section of ML Engineering of Google's ML Crash Course, read on SVD, an easy to understand article on Medium [You Donâ€™t Know SVD [Singular Value Decomposition](https://towardsdatascience.com/svd-8c2f72e264f)

**Day 4 (13 July 2020)** - Completed Google's ML Crash Course [notes here](https://github.com/ThymeLy/100DaysofML/blob/master/studyNotes/googleML_part3.md), started on edX Stanford's Online, Databases & SQL by Jennifer Widom

**Day 5 (14 July 2020)** - Started next Google AI course - Data preparation and feature engineering [my notes here](github.com/ThymeLy/100DaysofML/blob/master/studyNotes/MLdataprep.md), continued on EdX Stanford Online - Database & SQL (Querying relational database)

**Day 6 (15 July 2020)** - Continued on sampling and splitting data in ML data preparation course [(notes)](https://github.com/ThymeLy/100DaysofML/blob/master/studyNotes/sampling_splitting_data.md), continued on Jennifer Widom database course YouTube series on [well formed XML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR9aO4o52Eg&list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ0ML-cQSErtoTk2KrUzSZ2c&index=5)  

**Day 7 (16 July 2020)** - Learned about Randomization (Make your data generation pipeline reproducible), data transformation; XSD (XML Schema Definition) basics, a bit on JSON data

**Day 8 (17 July 2020)** - Learned about transforming numeric data by normalization or bucketing; JSON data, JSON schema, syntactically and semantically valid JSON 

**Day 9 (20 July 2020)** - Have been learning a bit previous two days, but didn't commit full one hour to it. Today's on database : relational algebra - natural join, theta join, union, difference, intersection operator. Google ML course data prep - Intro to modeling. Honestly don't even know the optimizer choice before, guess I need to have more background reading.

**Day 10 (21 July 2020)** - browsing around on scikit learn, seemed to be stuck on last part of Intro to modelling section, not sure can I even counted it as learning, cause I'm doing nothing.

**Day 11 (22 July 2020)** - finally read up on the [review article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0122-6#ref-CR161) of using deep learning in bioinformatics. Glad that I manage to understand some of those terms (saw it before in Google ML Crash Course). Machine learning is literally anywhere now, regardless of what field you are in. As long as you generate data, machine learning can have its foot in it. 

**Day 12 (24 July 2020)** - Skipping so many days, honestly don't know what am I doing. Today just do a quick read up on [Intro to Machine Learning in Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics-training.github.io/intro-machine-learning-2019/index.html). There are still a lot that I don't understand, especially on the R-code and package used to run the analysis. Continuing on Stanford database course - relational algebra done, moving back to SQL

**Day 13 (25 July 2020)** - Devoted 3 hours on ML today (can I counted it towards the following 2 days hah). Completed Google ML Data Prep and Feature Engineering although I need to admit that I still don't understand the last programming exercise part (Intro to modelling) - have been stuck there for many days and I need to move on. Read up a bit on data reshaping on R. Continuing EdX SQL query (SELECT, WHERE, FROM). Read up a bit on Machine Learning in R (most resources I used now focused mostly on using Python).

**Day 14 (27 July 2020)** - Mostly focused on learning SQL from Stanford database course in EdX (I know it's not machine learning though). Got the general feel that the syntax in SQL querying is very similar to dplyr package in R. Thinking of starting the famous Machine Learning course on Coursera.

**Day 15 (28 July 2020)** - Dwelling and pacing back and forth between different resources [Introduction to Data Science - rafalab](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/),  [Intro to Machine Learning in Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics-training.github.io/intro-machine-learning-2019), [An Introduction to Machine Learning in R](https://lgatto.github.io/IntroMachineLearningWithR/index.html), [Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) and [Statistical Modeling by Daniel Kaplan](https://dtkaplan.github.io/SM2-bookdown/), all these are in bookdown format  - the problem you have when they are too many resources on the internet and seems equally good for the subject at hand.

**Day 16 (29 July 2020)** - Continuing on Statistical Modeling (0.5 h). Trying on sentiment analysis in R based on this tutorial on [trump tweets](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/). Realised that I am still very weak in ggplot although been reading on it quite some time.

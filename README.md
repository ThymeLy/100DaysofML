# 100DaysofML

Inspired by #100DaysofCode and #100DaysofMLCode, starting mine as well, on 9 July 2020.
Also with some resources I find useful.

**Day 1 (9 July 2020)** - continuing on Google's Machine Learning Crash Course on ML Engineering [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning), also video on [Rules of Machine Learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml), continuing on Coursera Biology Meet Programming - it's evident that my Python fundamental is not strong enough

**Day 2 (10 July 2020)** - Google's Machine Learning Crash Course Data Dependencies, fairness; started on Khan Academy Linear Algebra

**Day 3 (11 July 2020)** - Completing Fairness section of ML Engineering of Google's ML Crash Course, read on SVD, an easy to understand article on Medium [You Donâ€™t Know SVD [Singular Value Decomposition](https://towardsdatascience.com/svd-8c2f72e264f)

**Day 4 (13 July 2020)** - Completed Google's ML Crash Course [notes here](https://github.com/ThymeLy/100DaysofML/blob/master/studyNotes/googleML_part3.md), started on edX Stanford's Online, Databases & SQL by Jennifer Widom

**Day 5 (14 July 2020)** - Started next Google AI course - Data preparation and feature engineering [my notes here](github.com/ThymeLy/100DaysofML/blob/master/studyNotes/MLdataprep.md), continued on EdX Stanford Online - Database & SQL (Querying relational database)

**Day 6 (15 July 2020)** - Continued on sampling and splitting data in ML data preparation course [(notes)](https://github.com/ThymeLy/100DaysofML/blob/master/studyNotes/sampling_splitting_data.md), continued on Jennifer Widom database course YouTube series on [well formed XML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR9aO4o52Eg&list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ0ML-cQSErtoTk2KrUzSZ2c&index=5)  

**Day 7 (16 July 2020)** - Learned about Randomization (Make your data generation pipeline reproducible), data transformation; XSD (XML Schema Definition) basics, a bit on JSON data

# Khan Academy Linear Algebra course
vector - need **magnitude** & **direction**

speed - scalar (no direction)
**v** or v (with arrow on top) = (5, 0) or vertical 5, 0 within []

lR^2 or **R** = 2D real coordinate space = all possible real-valued **2-tuple** (tuple = number)

lR3 = 3D real coordinate space -> real-valued 3-tuples

real-valued = no complex number/ part, e.g. i

IR^n = n-dimensional real coordinate space

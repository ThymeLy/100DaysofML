## SVD
- a vector can be decomposed into **length** and **direction**.
  ``` A * V = S ``` 
 just means a vector (A) is projected across axis (V) that results in the sum of S.
 - vector in SVD usually represented as matrix
 - two different matrix of row 1 - column 1, row 2 - column 2,  corresponds to the original vector.
